  <p> Our first major fundraiser was the Tough Kids BBQ 2019 where we sold 600 sausages, raising $900 for the Relay for Life. We also ran the popular Valentines Day balloon fundraiser and set up another BBQ at athletics day to raise more funds for the Relay for Life. Unfortunately, like so many events this year, the Relay for Life did not go ahead due to Covid-19. However, this did not stop us from continuing raising money from barbeques for the Cancer Society, raising $1000 in total, which is a great effort.
  
  <br> <br> A food drive was also held right after lockdown to help out those in our community who need it in these strange and unprecedented times. This was very successful, thanks  to our amazing LEO members and the Salvation Army were very happy to receive such a large donation of food.

 <br> <br> We also participated in the Buy-a-Brick fundraiser for the Southland Charity Hospital, raising $300 to buy three bricks. This money was raised from multiple barbeques run by various members of the club as we took turns running it each week. We are very proud to have contributed to such an important charity that will make a difference to our community.

 <br> <br> Our biggest event this year was the Hire-a-Helper. We moved locations into the gym and it was a huge success with participation from teachers, house captains, head students and of course, Mr Newell. We raised $1700 for the Borland Lodge. Borland Lodge is a non-profit organization where all our year 10 camps are held so it was great that the whole school got behind the event and contributed. Helpers cooked meals, baked cakes, entertained at lunchtimes and even washed cars.

 <br> <br>On Daffodil Day, the LEO Club managed to raise about $170 for the Cancer Society from selling daffodils. This is the seventh year we have participated in this fundraiser which really shows our commitment and dedication to contributing to our community. </p>

  <p> The LEO Club leaders would like to thank all of the club members who participated in the many events that were put on this year. Despite the many challenges and disappointments that came with this year, the LEO Club got stuck in and helped out the community in every way possible which is great to see. The participation and commitment from the whole club is what made this year so successful. We would also like to thank Mrs Elder and Ms Jenkinson who helped us along the way. They were so encouraging and helpful and we could not have done it without them. </p>
